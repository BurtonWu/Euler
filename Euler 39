/*
As a starter, based on the relation
   a^2+b^2 = c^2  (1)
If both a and b are even, c will also be even and P (the perimeter) will be even.
If both a and b are odd, c will be even and P will be even.
If one is even and the other is odd, c will be odd and P will again be even.
Therefore, only even values of P need to be checked.
